**Introduction to Berkshire Hathaway's 1979 Chairman's Letter**

The letter, written by Warren Buffett, discusses various aspects of Berkshire Hathaway's performance, investment strategy, and management approach in 1979. The company's commitment to transparent and accurate financial reporting is emphasized, along with the importance of understanding the underlying drivers of operating performance.

**Key Financial Highlights**

* Berkshire Hathaway's net worth increased in 1978 and 1979 due to changes in accounting principles, specifically the requirement for insurance companies to carry equity securities at market value.
* The company's operating earnings in 1979 were reasonably good, with an operating earnings rate of 18.6% of beginning net worth.
* The book value per share of Berkshire Hathaway has grown significantly over the years, from $19.46 in 1964 to $335.85 in 1979, representing a 20.5% compounded annual gain.

**Investment Strategy and Portfolio**

* Berkshire Hathaway's investment strategy focuses on long-term growth and value creation, with a preference for investing in good businesses at fair prices rather than poor businesses at bargain prices.
* The company's equity portfolio has a total market value of over $336 million, with major investments in companies like GEICO Corp., American Broadcasting Companies, and The Washington Post Company.
* The company is cautious about investing in long-term bonds due to high inflation expectations and prefers convertible bonds with an earnings retention factor similar to its equity portfolio.

**Insurance Operations and Underwriting**

* Berkshire Hathaway's insurance operations are managed with a focus on disciplined underwriting and profitability, with an emphasis on retaining staff and prioritizing profitability over fluctuating workloads.
* The company's insurance underwriting performance improved in 1979, with a notable success in a specific segment run by Phil Liesche, which generated an underwriting profit of $8.4 million.
* The company expects the insurance industry's underwriting ratio to worsen in 1980, but is confident in its own managers and their ability to navigate the challenges.

**Management Approach and Corporate Structure**

* Berkshire Hathaway's management approach delegates significant operating authority to key managers at the individual company or business unit level, resulting in a flat organizational structure with a small corporate headquarters.
* This approach allows for autonomy, speed, and talent to drive decision-making, and has resulted in a high level of productivity and achievements that have exceeded expectations.
* The company's CEO, Warren Buffett, prioritizes direct communication with shareholders, providing candid and detailed information about the business, similar to what would be expected in a private company.

**Outlook and Challenges**

* Berkshire Hathaway expects the equity markets in 1980 to underperform, but plans to maintain its current investments, focusing on long-term growth rather than short-term market fluctuations.
* The company is cautious about the potential risks associated with long-term bonds in an inflationary environment and is exploring options to comply with the divestment requirement of the Illinois National Bank and Trust Company.
* The company's forecast for 1980 includes a potential decline in return on equity and a risk of lower operating earnings, but is optimistic about its insurance equity investments and their potential to generate significant earning power over time.

Overall, the 1979 Chairman's Letter provides valuable insights into Berkshire Hathaway's investment strategy, management approach, and financial performance, highlighting the company's commitment to transparency, long-term value creation, and disciplined underwriting.
